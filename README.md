# Clustering
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique where similar data points are grouped together into clusters or groups based on certain similarities or patterns. 
The goal of clustering is to identify intrinsic structures in the data without the need for labeled outcomes. 
Clusters are represented by certain central points, such as centroids in K-Means or hierarchical cluster centers in agglomerative clustering. 
All of which were used in this project.  

I was tasked in this project to separate a dataset consisting of three numeric features (A, B, and C) into clusters.
I was to identify the number of discrete clusters present in the data and create a clustering model that separates the data into that number of clusters.
